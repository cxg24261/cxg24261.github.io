	<h1>Being Musicians In Athens</h1>
	<p>In around August of 2019, Retrophile made its debut as a band. With lead singer/guitarist Cristian Gutierrez and guitarist Zach Watkins having been in a band previously named "RuHaa!", the two had already had some experience in and around the Athens music scene.</p>
	<p>Retrophile has been actively performing at venues and for some organizations at UGA and are in the process of releasing new music. Cristian Gutierrez, says <q>Zach and I have <i>always</i> enjoyed playing music and we've wanted to show our sound to everyone we know. So this new band gives us the opportunity to show the world what we got.</q></p>
